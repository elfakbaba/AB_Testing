# AB_Testing
Facebook recently introduced a new bidding type called "average bidding" as an alternative to the existing "maximum bidding" bidding type. One of our clients, bombabomba.com, decided to test this new feature and would like to run an A/B test to determine if the average bid is driving more conversions than the maximum bid. The A/B test has been going on for 1 month and bombabomba.com is now waiting for you to analyze the results of this A/B test. The ultimate measure of success for Bombabomba.com is Purchase. Therefore, the Purchase metric should be the focus of statistical testing.

Project tasks are:

Formulate hypotheses
Assumption check
Normality Assumption (shapiro)
Homogeneity of Variance (levene)
Application of the hypothesis test
Independent two-sample t-test if assumptions are met
Mann-Whitney U test if assumptions are not met
Interpret the results based on p-value Note:
If normality assumption is not met, go directly to step 2. If homogeneity of variance assumption is not met, enter 1 in step 1 argument.
Outlier analysis and correction before normality check can be useful
